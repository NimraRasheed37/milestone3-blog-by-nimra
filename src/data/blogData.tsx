    <p>Harry Potter is written by J.K. Rowling and published by Bloomsbury.</p>
    <br />
    <p>If you don’t know what Harry Potter is, you’ve been living under a rock for 20 years but, I’ll be nice and tell you anyway. It’s about a boy called Harry who, on his 11th birthday, finds out he’s a wizard, goes off to a magic school called Hogwarts and finds out he is also The Chosen One. There are seven books in the series, and they document his adventures.</p>
    <br />
    <p>So, my mum probably won’t be too pleased with this review because, although she also loves Harry Potter (honestly, people who don’t are weirdos – I respect you completely, but you’re weird), she thinks that too many people like it for me to say it’s a favourite. But, the thing is, I genuinely love this series …and the movies, and the fandom (fan art, fanfic etc), and I could spout off random facts to you about it all day.</p>
 <br />
    <p>Although I know there are many things that people have pointed out as wrong with these books, I love them, and I think everyone should have the chance to read it. Therefore…</p>
 <br />
    <p>I recommend these books for every age and every place, and absolutely everyone should try them.</p>
    <br />
